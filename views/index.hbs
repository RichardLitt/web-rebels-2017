        <h2 class="f1 lh-solid">Call for Papers</h2>
        <p>Traditionally, Web Rebels has been invite-only for speakers. This time, for the first time, we open up for submissions from the community.</p>
        <p>We like to see anything that squarely fits into the spectrum of:
          <ul>
            <li>Cutting-edge technological advances in the world of JavaScript or computer science in general, if somehow applicable to JavaScript.</li>
            <li>Wild, crazy and clever stuff and hacks. Mad science!!</li>
            <li>Improving JavaScript developersâ€™ lives.</li>
            <li>Mobile JS.</li>
            <li>Embedded JS.</li>
            <li>Hardware JS.</li>
            <li>Web and application security.</li>
            <li>Fundamentals, in a modern light.</li>
            <li>Whatever you want! This is your conference.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The final speaker line-up will be a mix of invited speakers and those accepted from the CfP. <strong>The conference covers all travel and accommodation cost for accepted speakers in either case.</strong></p>
        <p>Submit your abstract via <a href="https://www.papercall.io/webreb2017">Papercall.io</a> <strong>before Jan 30th, 2017,</strong> and do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:kontor[ at ]webrebels.org">contact us</a> if you have any questions. We're happy to help.</p>
        <p> We particularly encourage people new to public speaking and members of underrepresented groups in tech to send in their suggestions.</p>
